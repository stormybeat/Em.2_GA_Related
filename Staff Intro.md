Hia, I'm Emily But I usually go by Em or Emmy.

I use fae/faer, she/her, or they/them pronouns, descending in order of preference.

I'm just one of your friendly neighborhood moderators, as well as a moderator for the Minecraft server we're partnered with!

I'm currently finishing up my Senior year of Highschool, and have plans to go to college in the fall. Also, I'm 18 y/o, my birthday falls somewhere within April. 

I've been learning German since 09/07/2022, even if I haven't made much progress recently. I'd love to move there at some point in my life, but a lot of things would have to fall into place before I could consider it. I currently live in the USA, though.

I like to build stuff. I've been on a robotics team for the past 4 years, and it's given me many valuable skills. Over the last year I've been learning a lot of programming for it, too!

Feel free to shoot me a dm about anything btw, I'm down.

If you need computer help, I have a few certifications, and I like to think I can do semi decently with things. 

I mostly listen to metal and punk rock music, but I keep a nice amount of variety.
